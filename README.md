A Cordova app for the Android platform. 

The app displays a Google Map for the area around the current location of the salesperson when at the client's premises and
placing or viewing an order.

When the salesperson clicks on Place NEW Order to start an empty order, the app displays the orders along the day’s journey with markers, 
where the location of client’s addresses are used to place the markers.

The app makes an order when the salesperson is at a client site with a valid id (OUCU) and password for the salesperson and the client id: 
1. The app validates the OUCU which starts with a letter and ends with a number.
2. The salesperson can navigate the widgets catalogue with Previous and Next buttons) and displays widget images, 
the description and asking price.
3. The app adds the currently displayed widget to the order items, including the amount and the agreed price.
4. The app displays the sum of ordered items and adding VAT to the agreed price of each of the order items at 20%.
